# 🚀 Vision  
MPC-Hashgraph-Wallet aims to solve enterprise-grade custody, auditability, and cryptographic security using a **multi-node, cryptographically accountable system** powered by @hashgraph.

This system allows:
- **Non-custodial key generation**
- **Threshold signing (no single point of failure)**
- **Hedera-verifiable audit logs**
- **Distributed workers executing MPC rounds**
- **Enterprise dashboards with live signing status**
